## Inspiration
CollabSpace was born out of the struggle many students and developers face when trying to find teammates, discover meaningful project ideas, and get mentorship. We wanted to create a single platform that makes collaboration seamless, fun, and productive.

## What it does
CollabSpace connects users with:
- Verified project ideas aligned with current technologies.
- Teammates who complement their skills.
- Mentors from industry who provide guidance.
It also provides a dashboard to track tasks, progress, and team communication in one place.

## How we built it
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with responsive design and card-based UI).
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express for APIs.
- **Database:** JSON file (db.json).
- **UI Enhancements:** Framer Motion for smooth animations.

## Challenges we ran into
- Designing a dashboard that was functional but not cluttered.
- Balancing persistence (localStorage) with session resets.
- Integrating chat and notifications without overwhelming the interface.
- Ensuring responsiveness across devices and screen sizes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Built a fully responsive, modern dashboard with clean UI.
- Integrated real-time chat simulation with connected teammates.
- Added notification dropdowns and milestone tracking.
- Created a platform that feels intuitive and engaging for users.

## What we learned
- The importance of user-centered design in collaboration tools.
- How to structure state management for tasks, chat, and notifications.
- Best practices for responsive layouts and accessibility.
- How small UI details (spacing, badges, shadows) dramatically improve clarity.

## What's next for CollabSpace
- Add **drag-and-drop task reordering** for better project management.
- Integrate **calendar and scheduling features**.
- Enable **real-time chat and notifications** using WebSockets or Firebase.
- Provide **dark mode** and customizable themes.
- Expand mentor network and verified project idea database.
